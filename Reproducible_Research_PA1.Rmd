# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1

## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
unzip("activity.zip")
d<-read.csv("activity.csv")
d[["ddate"]]=strptime(d$date,"%Y-%m-%d")
```

## Total number of steps taken each day
```{r}
steps_per_day <- aggregate(steps ~ date, d, sum)
hist(steps_per_day$steps,col="red",main="Total Steps Taken Each Day",xlab="Steps")
```

### Mean and Median values of steps
```{r eval=FALSE}
mean(steps_per_day$steps)
median(steps_per_day$steps)
```

The mean value of the total number of steps taken each day is `r mean(steps_per_day$steps)` and the median value is `r median(steps_per_day$steps)`.


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
